        2014, 20 dairy farmers met in palanpur, banaskantha, to form the madhavi
        Cooperative Creameries Association. Their idea was simple: Join together
        to effectively market and distribute membersâ€™ dairy production across
        the country. Today, our four businesses (spanning the whole agricultural
        system!) give us a farmer-to-fork view of agriculture.
